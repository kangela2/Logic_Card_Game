# Logic_Card_Game


This is a multiplayer card game you play in teams of 2 with 4 people total. This is a game of educated guesses. 

It will most likely stay as a single player game vs bots, but maybe there can be an option for multiplayer depending on how much time we have. There will be optionality for the difficulty of the opponents, and potentially be trained by an AI model. 

For the tech stack the front end will be TypeScript, React, and Bootstrap while the backend will be JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. For authentication I was thinking Firebase Authenitication and TBD for AI training, potentially use Pytorch or Tensorflow.
